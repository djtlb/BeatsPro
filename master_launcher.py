I notice you're in an empty file and asking "yes please" to something, but I don't have the context of what you'd like me to help you create in this `master_launcher.py` file.

Could you please clarify what functionality you'd like this master launcher to have? For example:
- Should it launch multiple processes or applications?
- Is it meant to be a GUI launcher or command-line based?
- What specific programs or scripts should it launch?

Please provide more details about what you want this launcher to do, and I'll help you create the appropriate code.
